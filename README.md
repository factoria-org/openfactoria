# Openfactoria

Openfactoria is a 100% open source serverless web application that is running at https://open.factoria.app

> This GitHub repository automatically publishes to https://open.factoria.app through GitHub pages.

# Usage

1. Upload files from the "Files" tab
2. From the "V2" tab, deploy a contract instantly
3. Set the configuration from the contract dashboard
4. Go live!

# Highlights

## 1. No server, no 3rd party

Openfactoria has no server. You directly post your files to IPFS through [nft.storage](https://nft.storage), and everything takes place inside the browser.

## 2. nft.storage

You will need to get a FREE https://nft.storage API key (run by Protocol labs, the developer of IPFS and Filecoin).

Once you get the API key, you can store your NFT content on nft.storage for free.

## 3. Powered by factoria F0 contract

The web app interacts with the Factoria [F0](https://github.com/factoria-org/f0) contract through JavaScript (mostly [F0.js](https://f0js.factoria.app/)).
